                        I don't reeaaally have a Social life, I'm usually on my room listening to music and navigating the web, exploring all I can. My personality likes to do little hops between episodes of "hyperactive optimism" and "nihilist negativity" as I like to call them.

                <h2> ‚úß Second Mayor Website Update! ‚úß </h2>
                <small>May 17, 2025</small>
                <p>
                    Hello <em>Wired</em>! This is this <em class="wpcontent">website's Second Mayor Update</em>! 
                </p>
                <p class="emoticons">Ÿ©(^·óú^ )Ÿà ¬¥-</p>
                <p>
                    I'll probably stop celebrating <em class="time">as soon as</em> I find the website is good enough to be fully <em class="socials">shared</em> hehe... Anyway, <em>y'all</em> have NO IDEA how proud I still am about the <em class="wpcontent">Matsuri's Music Player</em> on the <em class="wpcontent">side bar</em>. It's just, the best thing I've done in here so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today it's been fine, <em>me and my sibling</em> decided it's was <em class="time">time to clean and fix up</em> our <em class="rlcontent">home</em>, so that's what we did. I actually really like how <em class="rlcontent">everything turned out</em>. Have y'all ever felt the air after cleaning? Like it smells really nice, and I'm not referring to the chemicals used to clean, but the smell of air itself. It's just cleaner, fresher, [other adjectives]...
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of that cleaning left me really <em class="neg">exhausted</em> tho, my feet DO NOT want to move anymore. On the <em class="pos">bright side</em>, we finished so I can stay on my pc <em class="time">all the time</em> I want! And I'm using it to continue developing this <em class="wpcontent">website</em> more and more! <em class="time">This time</em> I tried adding more things that make it <em class="wpcontent">personal to me</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="emoticons">(„ÖÖ¬¥ Àò `)</p>
                <p>
                    Apart from the obvious addition of the <em class="wpcontent">Music Likes to the sidebar</em>, I also added other stuff like <em class="wpcontent">The One Meme</em> (That's the name I came up with, it's staying.) and some <em class="wpcontent"> quotes</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I actually just started getting into quotes and poems <em class="time">a month ago</em>, I don't know why tho, I <em class="time">used to</em> hate reading anything longer than 4 paragraphs! And the reason why is really silly: My <em>sibling</em> <em class="neg">forced me</em> to read 10 books <em class="time">during my vacations</em> and that really stick with me. <em class="time">Every time</em> I had to read something relatively big, my entire body would just <em class="neg">tense up</em>. But, for some reason, it doesn't <em class="time">anymore</em>.I started to slowly read some things and decided to add some quotes I found on tumblr to the <em class="wpcontent">website</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="emoticons">(,,>Ôπè<,,)</p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, I'm gonna go to sleep like right now so...
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em class="pos">Thanks for reading!</em> And remember to be positive!

                <h2> ‚úß So uhh... Welcome! ‚úß </h2>
                <small>May 16, 2025</small>
                <p>
                    It feels a bit weird to be talking to a <em>general audience </em>... I mean, as humans, we usually know who we're speaking to, either by meeting them in person or virtual. But this isn't like that, I'm currently speaking to <em>the void</em>, hoping for someone else to hear my comments and respond back.
                </p>
                <p class="emoticons">(ñ¶πÔπèñ¶π;)</p>
                <p>
                    Anyhow, If you're reading this at the <em class="time">time of publishing</em>, that means that either you stumbled upon my <em class="socials">Discord Description's Link </em> or you just found My <em class="socials">Github Repo</em>, either by chance of curiosity or I showed you... Hewwo!!! How is it? do you like it? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the <em class="time">first time</em> I made a website seriously and actually thinking things through. After all, I do WANT this website to last all my life as I add or change more and more stuff. I have a lot more planned, as you can see, the <em class="wpcontent">navigation bar</em> still doesn't work. Well, I mean it does, but it takes you to nowhere. I haven't done the other pages still.
                </p>
                <p class="emoticons"> (·µï‚Äî·¥ó‚Äî)/ Î™®</p>
                <p>
                    Also, now that i think about it, maybe I should do these <em class="wpcontent">Entries</em> at the <em class="time">end of the day</em>. I mean, i experience the day and gather my thoughts at the end, right? Then, I can successfully write something worth reading!
                </p>
                <p class="emoticons">( ‚Ä¢ ÃÄœâ‚Ä¢ÃÅ )‚úß</p>
                <p>
                    There is some <em class="pos">beauty</em> in this, isn't there? Just how the <em class="wpcontent">website</em> didn't exist a moment ago, and now here it is. Slowly developing in something more and more complex and styled...  I don't know, maybe it's just <em>me</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm loosing the topic, so I should stop <em class="time">before I continue</em> Yapping.
