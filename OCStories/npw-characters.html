                        <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                        <p>David Waltz presents in an interesting fusion of both organic and technological materials. His mesomorph build hints to a potential for both agility and strength, further enhanced by the addition of large, black feathered wings that allow him to make rapid aerial maneuvers. </p>

                        <p>His body is formed from an adaptive nanotechnology, a feature that grants him the extraordinary ability to navigate electrical power grids when in close proximity. For intense maneuvering, when his feathered wings are not enough, his hands and feet are equipped with four powerful plasma thrusters. Functionality is seamlessly integrated into his very being, with a practical flashlight built into his left eye and a laser emitter housed within his right.</p>

                        <p>In terms of attire, David often wears a sleek and black tuxedo. This formal wear is no ordinary suit though, as glowing blue and silver lines trace its seams, suggesting advanced circuitry woven directly into the fabric. The subtle application of nanotechnology allows this outfit to instantaneously shift its style and colors, adapting to any environment he finds himself in. In more casual settings, David adopts the contemporary clothing of whenever current time period he currently finds himself in, though these lack any discernible branding and frequently change in their combinations, perhaps reflecting his adaptable nature or a less personal connection to earthly fashion.</p>

                        <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                        <p>He is an extrovert hiding behind an introvert mask. Naturally charismatic, he has a remarkable ability to connect with people on a personal level. He is often very outgoing and energetic, particularly when sharing stories from his past or showcasing technological advances. His enthusiasm is infectious, but it sometimes makes him struggle to accept negative views, leading to a tendency to be pushy with those who are overly critical.</p>

                        <p>While he thrives in social gatherings and feels down during quieter times, he balances his expressive nature with a genuine empathy for others. He is often good at understanding and responding to people’s emotions, even if his high energy occasionally makes him unintentionally barge into conversations. Despite his outgoing personality, he values harmony in interactions, preferring to avoid or diffuse conflicts whenever possible.</p>

                        <p>Though he enjoys sharing his thoughts and ideas openly, he can also be an attentive listener—when the topic or person genuinely interests him. His charm, expressiveness, and drive to connect often leave a lasting impression on those around him.</p>
                        

                        <h3>Battle Description</h3>
                        <p>His primary weapon is a heavy, two-handed sword, a seemingly medieval choice augmented by cutting-edge technology. Integrated within the blade are small, powerful jets that can be activated to dramatically increase the force and speed of his swings, allowing for devastating melee attacks.</p>

                        <p>For engagements at a distance, David relies on a substantial, military-grade sniper rifle. Fueled by plasma, this weapon delivers high-powered energy blasts with pinpoint accuracy. Its robust design suggests both durability and the capacity to handle intense combat situations.</p>

                        <p>Adding an unexpected element to his arsenal is a modified wooden bow. This seemingly simple weapon is anything but, designed for accuracy and likely employing specialized arrows or enhancements that align with his advanced capabilities. This bow offers a quieter, more precise option for specific tactical scenarios.</p>

                        <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                        <p>The Demon Queen Corruption commands attention with a presence that is both regal and terrifying. Her Rakshasa lineage is evident in her striking features, twisted into a form that exudes power. While possessing an athletically toned physique, a layer of lean muscle suggests formidable strength beneath her demonic bearing. Adding to her otherworldly silhouette are a set of black, often hidden, demon wings, hinting at a capacity for swift and silent aerial movement. Crowned by sharp, Pyrenean goat horns, her head further emphasizes her demonic nature and potent authority.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps her most unsettling feature lies within her gaze: her pupils are shaped like stark white skulls, a constant reminder of her malevolent nature and connection to death. Defying gravity, Corruption is rarely seen on solid ground, preferring to hover just above the floor.</p>

                        <p>Corruption's choice of attire reflects a duality in her nature. One moment she might be seen in a black cropped top adorned with jagged lettering, layered beneath an oversized hoodie with subtle, perhaps arcane, patterns. Fishnet details at her midriff add a touch of edgy texture, while black cargo pants, complete with straps, chains, and metal rings, speak to a more combative and utilitarian side. In stark contrast, she might appear in a sleek, cropped gray top with cut-out shoulders paired with high-waisted gray trousers, presenting a more modern and streamlined silhouette accented by a vibrant yellow bandana tied around her neck, a surprising pop of color against her darker aspects.</p>

                        <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                        <p>She is an exceptionally entitled demon who firmly believes she deserves everything the world has to offer without putting in any effort to earn it. When things don’t go her way, she throws dramatic and destructive tantrums, showing just how deeply her entitlement runs. Manipulation is her greatest weapon; she excels at getting inside people’s minds, using deceit and false promises to twist them to her will. She has a keen eye for weaknesses and exploits them ruthlessly, often bullying her targets into submission with relentless mockery and cruelty.</p>
                        
                        <p>Her inflated ego dominates her personality, making her dismissive of anyone she deems weaker or less significant. She takes immense pleasure in mocking others, especially when she senses vulnerability. Her impatience is another defining trait—she has no tolerance for delays or resistance, demanding immediate gratification and growing irritable when faced with obstacles.</p>

                        <p>Stubborn, she refuses to back down or compromise, clinging to her desires and plans with unyielding determination. This makes her not only difficult to reason with but also incredibly volatile, as she’ll stop at nothing to get what she wants. </p>

                        <p>Her playful side is laced with cruelty—she treats situations and people like toys, finding joy in toying with their emotions and watching them squirm under her control.</p>

                        <h3>Battle Description</h3>
                        <p>Her primary weapon is a massive magical scythe, forged from a menacing combination of dark metal and jagged basalt. This formidable implement likely possesses enchantments that amplify its destructive capabilities, making it a deadly tool in close combat.</p>

                        <p>Adding a unique and unsettling dimension to her offense, Corruption can weaponize her own hidden demon wings. Their inherent sharpness allows her to utilize them as deadly blades or projectiles, catching opponents off guard with swift and brutal attacks.</p>

                        <p>Beyond conventional weaponry, Corruption's true strength lies in her mastery of deceptive magic. She is a skilled illusionist, capable of creating convincing clones to confuse her enemies, masking entire scenes to control the battlefield, and even manipulating pocket dimensions for strategic advantage. Her most insidious ability lies in blurring the memories of her foes, sowing confusion and eroding their will to fight.</p>

                        <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                        <p>Jack Narug presents as a distinctive Wolf-human Robot hybrid, his appearance a blend of animalistic features, human formality, and underlying mechanical structure. He possesses an "Upside-Down triangle" body type, characterized by broad shoulders that taper down, hinting at a build designed for strength and a commanding presence, despite his modest height of 5'8". Adding to his unique silhouette, a pair of hidden, purely decorative white wings are subtly integrated, suggesting an elegant, almost ceremonial aspect rather than a functional one.</p>

                        <p>His wolf lineage is apparent in his soft, yet alert, ear-like structures atop his head, coordinating with a long, expressive tail. His formal attire is paramount to his identity; he is exclusively seen in a sleek, dark suit, crisp white shirt, and a tie, reflecting his role and precise nature. This formal wear is devoid of the advanced, integrated circuitry seen in higher-generation models, emphasizing a more classic, unaugmented presentation.</p> 

                        <p> Subtle hints of his favored Mint Green or secondary Cadbury Purple might appear in understated accents like a tie pattern, a pocket square, or the stitching, adding personal flair within his strict dress code. His face is framed by a pair of glasses, and a distinctive cross earring adorns one ear, further contributing to his composed and methodical demeanor. Unlike more advanced robotic entities, Jack's internal mechanisms and technological integrations are more contained and less overtly adaptable, reflecting his designation as a lower-generation model.</p>



                        <h3>Personality Description</h3>
                        <p>Jack Narug's way of acting shows a big change he's gone through. He used to be a very lively and maybe even overly friendly robot. But after some tough experiences—especially his fights with David and leaving the National Protector of the World (NPW) because he felt trapped there—he's become a very calm and controlled person. His old lively self has been replaced by someone more careful and often critical.</p>

                        <p>He usually keeps a steady, calm face, almost never showing strong feelings. But deep down, he feels a lot of dislike for anything that doesn't fit his strong personal rules or what he expects. This often comes out as sharp sarcasm; his replies and comments are usually full of dry wit, meant to quietly or openly show he disapproves without losing his cool. He sees things like not being consistent, acting illogically, or not being professional with a hidden annoyance, often saying his criticisms in a blunt, direct way.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps the most unique and surprising part of his personality is how much he respects the job of a butler. He thinks a butler's duties, discipline, and strong dedication are incredibly important, seeing them as the perfect example of service, order, and doing things exactly right. This strong interest isn't just admiration; he really looks up to people who act like this and can be very critical of those who don't. This specific focus suggests he really wants things to be structured and perfect in a world he often finds messy and disappointing, showing how he moved from a more chaotic past to a very organized present.</p>



                        <h3>Battle Description</h3>
                        <p>His primary weapons are a series of specially designed utility knives, often concealed within his formal wear or disguised as common butler implements. These are not brute force weapons but rather tools of precision. Crafted for silent and swift use, they allow him to engage in close-quarters combat with remarkable accuracy, targeting weak points or disarming opponents with fluid, almost surgical movements. He treats his knives with the same care and respect a butler would give their finest silverware, ensuring they are always pristine and razor-sharp.</p>

                        <p>For situations requiring a different approach, Jack can utilize his environment and knowledge of tactical vulnerabilities. His lower-generation mechanics mean he lacks the integrated weaponry or advanced energy projection of more modern robots. Instead, his strength lies in observation and timing. He can quickly identify structural weaknesses, create diversions, or use the terrain to his advantage, maneuvering with a quiet, almost unnoticeable grace that belies his formal appearance. His combat is less about overwhelming force and more about the swift, clean, and decisive neutralization of a threat, much like a perfectly executed service.</p>
